				3D Graph Program

This 3dgraph.py program provides the python users with a flexible surface 
plot package for displaying any 2D image or multi-line data from any Ascii 
file. The Ascii file must be column or row oriented data set.

It also provides the user with various methods of displaying the 2D 
image array as surface or mesh plot. A fixed color spectrum from 
Pmw.Color.spectrum is used by this program. By default the color filled 
line spectrum is plotted for multi-columns of data. For the performance 
purpose for large dimension array which exceeds 200, by default setting
it is automatically rebin to 200x200 for 3D graphic plot. A user can
unset this default setting if actual real data dimension is desired.

The configration file 3dgraph.config is used for easy startup of this
program. This configuration file is also shared by tv.py for accessing
the 3D graphics.

It consists of top menu bar, drawing area, command button area, and message 
bar area. The user interface is briefly given below:

The python subpackage required by by this program include Tk, Pmw, PIL, 
and Numeric.

			USER INTERFACE

The main program consists a menubar, drawing area, command button area,
and message bar area. The canvas drawing area is used for displaying any
grphics generated by this program. The help message on each menu item
or button is displayed in the message bar area. 

An image display frame is designed to show the TV image of input data
array. A mouse motion event is bind with the image plot to reflects
the X,Y,Z value of the mouse cursor. 

The command button area consists of 'Print' and 'Close' buttons:
Print	- button to send the content of drawing area to the 
	  default  PS printer
Close	- button to close the program
ROI...	- dialog to extract region of interest and replot the ROI
	  The 'Reset ROI...' button on pick step/Row slices dialog will
	  reset to default read in ascii data array again.

The menu bar interface is given below.

			File Menu

Open Ascii File... 	- dialog to load column oriented ascii input file
			  and display color spectrum multi-row plot
Printer...		- dialog to override the default printer

			Setup Menu

Display Ascii File...	- display the contents of ascii file loaded in
Transpose X,Y		- transpose X,Y axis and replot the multi-row plot
Clear Canvas Plot	- clear the plot in drawing area
Show Edge Line		- checkbutton for displaying edge line on step  
			  multi-line plot
Display Rebin Array	- checkbutton affects large ascii data array, whether 
			  use to 200x200 bins or raw data array dimensions

			SpectrumColor Menu

Surface Shading		- show data as spectrum color shaded surface plot
Surface Shading (stepwise) - show spectrum color shaded surface by stepwise 
Surface Plot		- show values as colored specturm polygons 
Surface with Vertical Bar - plot 2D surface values with vertical bar skirt

			ColorTable Menu

Use Color Table...      - dialog to pick and show surface in picked color table
Use Rainbow+White Color Table - surface in rainbow + white color table
Use Ave Cell Color Option - check button to use average cell color value
				default use one corner value only


			MeshLine Menu

Surface Mesh Plot	- plot 2D array as meshed grid lines
All Row Lines 		- plot 2D array as multiple horizontal rows
All Step Lines 		- plot 2D array as multiple vertical step rows
Pick Row Lines...  	- dialog to enter desired Y step indecies
Pick Step Lines...  	- dialog to enter desired X step indecies
			  with check button for step lines in spectrum color
			  scheme, default use simple step line plot
