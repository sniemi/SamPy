"""Demo of image with contour overlay

This demo displays an HST image of NGC 1275 taken with three different
filters combined as an RGB image with contours of an aligned Chandra
X-Ray image (smoothed) of the same object overplotted

The data for the images are stored as simple binary files and the
necessary shape and type info is added by the loaddata function (as
well as decompression for the HST image).

The demo creates a figure window that is the size of the HST image in
pixels so that no resampling is done, scales the plot window (axes) to
fill the figure window.  Resizing the window will modify the aspect
ratio, but correspondence between the HST image and contour image will
always be correct

The HST image was obtained from the Hubble Heritage web pages
