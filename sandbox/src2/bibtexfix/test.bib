title = {Revised photometric distances to nearby dwarf galaxies in the IC 342/Maffei complex},
abstract = {The results of DAOPHOT photometry of several hundred stars in five irregular galaxies are presented using V and I CCD frames, obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope under a 0.6 arcsec seeing. Based on the brightest blue and red stars we estimate the following distances to the galaxies: 3.2 Mpc for UGCA 105, 2.6 Mpc for UGCA 86, 1.8 Mpc for UGCA 92, 1.7 Mpc for NGC 1569, and 1.7 Mpc for Cas 1. The problem of membership of the galaxies to the IC 342/Maffei complex is briefly discussed Tables 2 to 6 are only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Abstract.html},

title = {Detecting Clusters of Galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I. Monte Carlo Comparison of Cluster Detection Algorithms},
abstract = {We present a comparison of three cluster-finding algorithms from imaging data using Monte Carlo simulations of clusters embedded in a 25 deg2 region of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data: the matched filter (MF; Postman et al., published in 1996), the adaptive matched filter (AMF; Kepner et al., published in 1999), and a color-magnitude filtered Voronoi tessellation technique (VTT). Among the two matched filters, we find that the MF is more efficient in detecting faint clusters, whereas the AMF evaluates the redshifts and richnesses more accurately, therefore suggesting a hybrid method (HMF) that combines the two. The HMF outperforms the VTT when using a background that is uniform, but it is more sensitive to the presence of a nonuniform galaxy background than is the VTT; this is due to the assumption of a uniform background in the HMF model. We thus find that for the detection thresholds we determine to be appropriate for the SDSS data, the performance of both algorithms are similar; we present the selection function for each method evaluated with these thresholds as a function of redshift and richness. For simulated clusters generated with a Schechter luminosity function (M*r=-21.5 and Î±=-1.1), both algorithms are complete for Abell richness >~1 clusters up to z~0.4 for a sample magnitude limited to r=21. While the cluster parameter evaluation shows a mild correlation with the local background density, the detection efficiency is not significantly affected by the background fluctuations, unlike previous shallower surveys.},

title = {The Dynamics of Poor Systems of Galaxies},
abstract = {We assemble and observe a sample of poor galaxy systems that is suitable for testing N-body simulations of hierarchical clustering and other dynamical halo models. We (1) determine the parameters of the density profile rho(r) and the velocity dispersion profile sigma_p(R), (2) separate emission-line galaxies from absorption-line galaxies, examining the model parameters and as a function of spectroscopic type, and (3) for the best-behaved subsample, constrain the velocity anisotropy parameter, beta, which determines the shapes of the galaxy orbits. Our sample consists of 20 systems, 12 of which have extended X-ray emission in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. We measure the 877 optical spectra of galaxies brighter than m_R~15.4 within 1.5 h^-1 Mpc of the system centers (we take H_0=100 h km s^-1 Mpc^-1). Thus, we sample the system membership to a radius typically three times larger than other recent optical group surveys. The average system population is 30 galaxies, and the average line-of-sight velocity dispersion is ~300 km s^-1. The Navarro, Frenk, {\&} White universal profile and the Hernquist model both provide good descriptions of the spatial data. In most cases an isothermal sphere is ruled out. Systems with declining sigma_p(R) are well-matched by theoretical profiles in which the star-forming galaxies have predominantly radial orbits (beta>0) many of these galaxies are probably falling in for the first time. There is significant evidence for spatial segregation of the spectroscopic classes regardless of sigma_p(R).},

title = {The nature and space density of fossil groups of galaxies},
abstract = {We describe the properties of a sample of galaxy groups with very unusual distributions of galaxy luminosities. The most extreme example has an X-ray luminosity similar to that of the Virgo cluster but has a very low richness, with only one galaxy brighter than L*, compared with six in Virgo. That one galaxy, however, is optically more luminous than any galaxy in Virgo and has an optical luminosity as bright as many of the central cD galaxies in rich Abell clusters. The characteristic feature of the fossil groups we study is that most of the light arises from one dominant, central galaxy. We define a fossil system and, based on this definition, construct a small X-ray-selected, flux-limited sample of fossil groups with well-known selection criteria. We confirm that these systems are indeed groups of galaxies, but dominated by one central luminous giant elliptical galaxy and with few, or no, L* galaxies. We find that fossil systems represent 8-20 per cent of all systems of the same X-ray luminosity. Fossil groups are at least as numerous as all poor and rich clusters combined, and are thus a possible site for the formation of luminous central cluster galaxies before infall into clusters occurs. The fossil systems in our sample have significantly higher X-ray luminosities than normal groups of similar total optical luminosities (or similar X-ray temperature, where the latter can be measured). These enhanced X-ray luminosities may be due to relatively cool gas in the innermost regions or due to a low central gas entropy. We interpret fossil groups as old, undisturbed systems which have avoided infall into clusters, but where galaxy merging of most of the L* galaxies has occurred. An early formation epoch, before that of most groups, could explain low central gas entropies and high X-ray luminosities.},

title = {A MaxBCG Catalog of 13,823 Galaxy Clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey},
abstract = {We present a catalog of galaxy clusters selected using the maxBCG red-sequence method from Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric data. This catalog includes 13,823 clusters with velocity dispersions greater than ~400 km s-1 and is the largest galaxy cluster catalog assembled to date. They are selected in an approximately volume-limited way from a 0.5 Gpc3 region covering 7500 deg2 of sky between redshifts 0.1 and 0.3. Each cluster contains between 10 and 190 E/S0 ridgeline galaxies brighter than 0.4L* within a scaled radius R200. The tight relation between ridgeline color and redshift provides an accurate photometric redshift estimate for every cluster. Photometric redshift errors are shown by comparison to spectroscopic redshifts to be small (Îz~=0.01), essentially independent of redshift, and well determined throughout the redshift range. Runs of maxBCG on realistic mock catalogs suggest that the sample is more than 90% pure and more than 85% complete for clusters with masses >=1Ã1014 Msolar. Spectroscopic measurements of cluster members are used to examine line-of-sight projection as a contaminant in the identification of brightest cluster galaxies and cluster member galaxies. Spectroscopic data are also used to demonstrate the correlation between optical richness and velocity dispersion. Comparison to the combined NORAS and REFLEX X-ray-selected cluster catalogs shows that X-ray-luminous clusters are found among the optically richer maxBCG clusters. This paper is the first in a series that will consider the properties of these clusters, their galaxy populations, and their implications for cosmology.},

abstract = {A method of classifying groups of galaxies, called hierarchical clustering, is presented as a tool for the investigation of nearby groups of galaxies. The method is free from model assumptions about the groups. Scaling of the different coordinates is necessary, and the level from which one accepts the groups as real has to be determined. Hierarchical clustering is applied to an unbiased sample of galaxies in the Leo region. Five distinct groups result which have reasonable physical properties, such as low crossing times and conservative mass-to-light ratios, and which follow a radial-velocity-luminosity relation. Only four out of 39 galaxies were adopted as field galaxies.},

title = {Surface brightness fluctuation distances for nearby dwarf elliptical galaxies},
abstract = {We obtained deep B and R-band CCD images for the dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies DDO 44, UGC 4998, KK98 77, DDO 71, DDO 113, and UGC 7356 at the Nordic Optical Telescope. Employing Fourier analysis technique we measure stellar R-band surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs) and magnitudes in 29 different fields of the galaxies. Independent tip of the red giant branch distances for DDO 44, KK98 77, DDO 71 are used to convert their set of apparent into absolute SBF magnitudes. The results are combined with the corresponding local (B-R) colours and compared with the (B-R)-/line{M}R relation for mainly old, metal-poor stellar populations as predicted by Worthey's population synthesis models using Padova isochrones. While the colour dependency of the theoretical relation is confirmed by the empirical data, we find a systematic zero point offset between observations and theory in the sense that models are too faint by 0.13 (+/-0.02) mag. Based on these findings we establish a new semiempirical calibration of the SBF method as distance indicator for dE galaxies with an estimated uncertainty of ~10%. Taking first advantage of the improved calibration, we determine SBF distances for the other three early-type dwarfs UGC 4998, DDO 113, and UGC 7356. Although found in the M 81 group region, previous velocity measurements suggested UGC 4998 is a background galaxy. This picture is confirmed by our SBF distance of 10.5 (+/-0.9) Mpc. We can further identify DDO 113 as a faint stellar system at the near side of the Canes Venatici I (CVn I) cloud at a distance of 3.1 (+/-0.3) Mpc. The second CVn I member in our sample, UGC 7356, lies at 6.7 (+/-0.6) Mpc and spatially close to NGC 4258 (M 106). We derive BR surface brightness profiles and colour gradients for all dwarfs and determine photometric and S{\'e}rsic parameters. Finally, we discuss two non-stellar objects in DDO 71 and UGC 7356 which may resemble globular clusters. Based on observations collected at the Nordic Optical Telescope.},

Our results confirm that projection effects alone can account for the high incidence of discordant redshifts in compact groups. We have also examined the spatial distribution of discordant galaxies in Hickson's compact groups. Contrary to previous studies, we find that there is no evidence for a central concentration of discordant galaxies.},
